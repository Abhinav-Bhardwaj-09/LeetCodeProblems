# Problem No. 1
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    You can return the answer in any order.


## Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## Example 2:

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

## Example 3:

    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

# Problem No. 191
    Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

_Note:_
-   Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.


-   In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.


## Example 1:

    Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

## Example 2:

    Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
    Output: 1
    Explaination: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

## Example 3:

    Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
    Output: 31
    Explaination: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

# Problem No. 258
     Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.


## Example 1:

    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
                        38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
                        11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
                 Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

## Example 2:

    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0

# Problem No. 771
    You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

    Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".


## Example 1:

    Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3

## Example 2:

    Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"

# Problem No. 832
    Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
<br />

    To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.
-   For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].

<br/>

    To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.

-   For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].

## Example 1:

    Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
    Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
    Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
                 Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]


## Example 2:

    Input: image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
    Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
    Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
                 Then, invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]

# Problem No. 1281
    Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

## Example 1:

    Input: n = 234
    Output: 15
    Explanation: Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
                 Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

## Example 2:

    Input: n = 4421
    Output: 21
    Explanation: Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32
                 Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11

    +-------------+------+

    (emp_id, event_day, in_time) is the primary key of this table.
    The table shows the employees' entries and exits in an office.
    event_day is the day at which this event happened, in_time is the minute at which the employee entered the office, and out_time is the minute at which they left the office.
    in_time and out_time are between 1 and 1440.
    It is guaranteed that no two events on the same day intersect in time, and in_time < out_time.

<br/>

    Write an SQL query to calculate the total time in minutes spent by each employee on each day at the office. Note that within one day, an employee can enter and leave more than once. The time spent in the office for a single entry is out_time - in_time.

    Return the result table in any order.
